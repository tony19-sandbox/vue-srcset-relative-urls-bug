> Demo Vue bug where relative `srcset` URLs are not transformed

It looks like `@vue/compiler-sfc` has a bug, introduced in `v3.0.0-beta.9` when [adding support for absolute URLs in `srcset`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/commit/6a0be882d4ce95eb8d8093f273ea0e868acfcd24). This bug bypasses the [transformation that would've resolved the asset URLs in `srcset`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/blob/5eb72630a53a8dd82c2b8a9705c21a8075161a3d/packages/compiler-sfc/src/templateTransformSrcset.ts#L98-L158).
